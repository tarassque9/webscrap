            "description": "Docplexus is the largest online community, exclusive to Doctors from India.\n\nUnequivocally, people round the globe agree that healthcare is one of the biggest challenge that faces humanity. Economies of developing countries are buckling under the pressures of increasing populations and exploding medical costs. As a nation, India battles to balance the cost, access, and quality of healthcare services. \n\nDocplexus wants to solve this innovation challenge. One question that we ask every day is \u201cHow can the stakeholders in Indian health care leverage modern technology to make a positive impact on the society\u201d.\n\nTo find out if doctors in India would adopt technology to improve their clinical outcomes, we launched Docplexus platform in June 2014. Since then it has been an exhilarating journey for us. The response from doctors has been so motivating that they believe they have found the key to unlock \u2018Knowledge Silos\u2019 which often results in costly and often deadly outcomes for patients. \n\nTheir Mission \u2013 Empowering Doctors \nAs a company, their mission is to \u2018Empower Doctors\u2019 by providing them access to peer advice, expert opinion, medical guidelines and latest advances in topics of medicine. A more informed doctor is better positioned to make clinical decision and it subsequently results in overall improved healthcare. \n\nDocplexus focuses on peer-to-peer exchange of patient cases, dialogue and interdisciplinary learning to improve medical outcomes. It is a trusted and secure platform accessible exclusively for medical practitioners, offering real-time dialogue, exchange and interaction in clinical and non-clinical forums, knowledge centers, treatment guidelines, certified educational resources and latest medical news. \n\n",

            "description": "Teqplay is a context broker providing information and tools to empower the shipping industry to make smarter and better informed decisions in both planning and execution. Our aim is to improve asset utilization, spot opportunities in time and reduce waste in operational costs on fuel (CO2 reduction) and labor.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of ships and terminals doesn\u2019t adapt continuously and in real time to the dynamics in the changing world. That\u2019s why insight information, both real-time and predicted, is needed. This enables adaptive decision making for shipowners, charterers, terminals and port authorities.  We allow for smarter up-front planning. Our technology monitors the execution and enables the industry to pro-actively adapt and coordinate.\r\n \r\nVia 24/7 monitoring of vessels, port operations and the external circumstances, we can share the insight. Simply because we know the actual status and history, and we can predict the future with machine learning and AI. Moreover, we provide a single point of truth based on open data sources for each port, allowing for an easy bootstrap. This single point of truth can be shared among the different port call stakeholders in order to optimize decision making. The single point of truth will be enhanced if more and more stakeholders will share their data, allowing us to create even more sophisticated solutions.\r\n\r\nWe deliver solutions for port call optimization and maritime supply chain optimization, covering both sea and inland domain, including planning of quays, vessels, bunkering and ship to ship transfer. Our solutions are developed in close collaboration with our customers. They provide insight where potential gains or saving can be achieved and empower our clients to convert this insight into real profits and cost savings.",

            "description": "Travelers don\u2019t know the locations of most licensed money changers (LMCs) or banks\u2019 bureau de changes (BdCs), never mind their rates, which can vary by 30% even within walking distance, and can be as much as 200% or more in extreme cases. Meanwhile, LMCs have poor customer acquisition strategies & insights, as well as cash management and \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d (KYC) & other regulatory challenges. They do not have the know-how to automate their services resulting in low productivity & margins. In addition, retailers and service providers wish to advertise and sell their goods & services to travellers that, when they search for or exchange currency, have a high desire to purchase.\n\nCurrenSeek is a platform connecting LMCs and BdCs to travellers and businesses so that:\n\u2022\tTravellers discover the best and most convenient currency exchange locations with the option to book and pay online, and even pickup at convenient third-party locations \u2013 e.g. airports;\n\u2022\tBusinesses list their foreign currency requirements for LMCs to make bids, and offer delivery and e-payment options;\n\u2022\tLMCs are able to attract more customers, especially online, perform higher-value transactions, and better manage inventory, compliance and risk.\n\nCurrenSeek works directly with banks & LMCs to obtain their rates and display them on a map or on their/third-party websites, allowing users to lock-in the rate and electronically purchase foreign currency. LMCs also have tools to offer customised deals, accept bookings & real-time e-payments and perform basic KYC. Travel partners are able to advertise and electronically sell their good & services via the app or the money changers' websites and branches \u2013 all facilitated by CurrenSeek.\n",

They believe schools are the pillars of our society, but they are too expensive to operate and are unable to offer meaningful language practice to students once they are outside the classroom.\n\nThey are setting out to fix this.\n\nTheir blended classroom-and-tech based program consistently offers high-quality instruction to students, wherever they may be, while lessening the burden of schools' low-scalability. Vahan provides a low-cost and easily accessible service for students with feature and smartphones, and it works in conjunction with their schools.

A value seeker is some one who is looking to be entertained, to be thrilled, to stay informed, to gain knowledge, to make money at the minimum viable cost aka 'free'. If you are a value seeker then you can be a student looking to better unravel math or science outside the classroom, a fresh graduate looking for expert advice to nail a job interview, a single working mom using her free time to build an extra skill set to generate more income for her family, a dad searching for the best schools for his kids.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a value provider who is spending resources to share knowledge and information for free, you are still looking to be compensated because without an income your business model will not be sustainable. A value provider can be a news network bringing live news and expert opinions at no cost to the reader, a blogger who is enriching the lives of his millions of followers with the life lessons or funny stories he shares every day, an entrepreneur who has started an online business and is looking to make money so that he can sustain it and continue providing unique value to his online visitors. \n\nAdPushup empowers publishers by helping them increase revenue from their display ad inventory. Their product automatically and continuously optimizes ad layouts with its machine learning algorithm which results in a higher CTR (click through rate) without compromising on the UX. ",

Where community and belonging matters - where together, is most important.\n\nWith the advent of the Digital Age, too many of us have become Digital Nomads. Scattered to the wind, individuals that lack roots or a sense of belonging to any one given location.\n\nYet history has proven that humans are social creatures. The Dalai Lama famously said - \n\u201cWe human beings are social beings. We come into the world as the result of others\u2019 actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others\u2019 activities. For this reason, it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others.\u201d \n\nCooliv is the brief respite in this era of social alienation. Come make \u201cTogether\u201d better - cooperate, collaborate, and take up the mantle of the e-tribe. ",

Such a platform would enable consumers to study the market, evaluate the options they face, and ultimately select the product tailored to their needs.\n\nIn Pakistan's banking sector, the lack of such a platform leaves consumers handicapped and forces them to rely solely on their bank representatives to provide them the best possible solutions to their financing needs.",

It is their mission to further the growth of the Bitcoin network in the Philippines, by providing universal access to otherwise inaccessible financial services, enabling unemcumbered participation in the internet economy regardless of the size of your bank account, and fostering innovation without permission from central authorities.\n\nThe Philippines is the second largest recipient for remittances in Asia, with a total of US$26 billion transferred in 2013. The lion's share of these remittances are enabled by conventional banks and money transfer agents, which charge hefty fees for international transactions. Rebit aims to provide a comparable service at a significantly lower rate by leveraging the superior process that the Bitcoin platform enables. They strive for total transparency in both their business model and service fees, and offer the best BTC-to-PHP payout rates in the Philippines. Their delivery options include forwarding to most local banks, as well as the most popular pawnshops and payment centers.",

            "description": "Tripovo combines the expertise and support of a travel agent with the convenience and savings of booking online. \n\nTripovo started out of the frustration from the current way of booking tour packages. Having worked many years in a travel agency, they experienced the inflexibility and slowness in responding to requested changes to an itinerary. They also saw people trying to book online, but with difficulty in combining multiple parts of a trip or getting advice from online companies. \n\nTravelers want choice and freedom, with the knowledge of having a travel expert be there should we need them. Tripovo is the answer. When planning your holiday, Tripovo allows you to fully customize your itinerary with a list of curated activities and hotels, to ensure you always get the best travel experience. And after booking, they will be there to answer any questions you may have until you return home. \n\nBy combining many different providers and offering special pricing, depending on the number of items being bought, Tripovo is cheaper than booking each item individually or through a travel agency.\n\nThey are passionate about travel and love exploring new places, experiencing new cultures and returning home with their horizons changed. They hope Tripovo makes the process of planning your holiday easier and in turn, encourages you to travel more.",

Our mission is to help young people discover careers they love and to develop the right skills sets, while empowering employers to hire the right young talent effectively.\n\nIn Sept 2016, Glints successfully closed a US$2 million Series A funding. Co-led by Golden Equator Capital and Gobi Partners, the latest financing round also includes participation from Wavemaker Partners and Fresco Capital. Existing investors East Ventures, Singapore Infocomm Investments (IIPL), Pix Vine Capital, and angel investors including Darius Cheung, founder of 99.co, also joined the round in a vote of confidence for the startup.\n\nGlints is starting to establish itself as the #1 young professional recruitment platform in the region, with its large and growing network of 300,000 young job seekers and multiple partnerships with schools. To name a few, these partnering schools include National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU), Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and Singapore Polytechnic (SP). \n\nAdditionally, over 10,000 companies, including large organisations such as UOB and Adidas, and startups such as Grab and Carousell, have worked with Glints to attract and hire young talent to join their organisations. Most recently, Glints also caught the attention and partnered with government organisations such as Economic Development Board (EDB), International Enterprise (IE Singapore) and Skillsfuture SG (SSG).\n",

            "description": "Parenting is an emotional journey. Lot of the parents are worried about their babies, even when their babies are not sick . For example, parents are often concerned whether their babies are hitting their milestones at right time, like teething, crawling, beginning to start etc. Parents also need to know when to start vaccination and schedule for different vaccination. Friends, family often cannot provide help because may be they are not going through the same phase of parenting or do not have the experience to give the advice. \n\nOn the other hand, with the increasing power of smartphone cameras, people now use mobile phone to take photos of themselves, their kids and share with friends and family more than ever before. \n\nWe have found out that:\n \n1. Although there are many photo editing and sharing apps, there is still lacking for a community for parents & babies where they can not only share photos but also discuss their daily parenting issues or their pregnancy problems. \n2. Existing social networking sites are too noisy to discuss sensitive baby and pregnancy issues, while also lacking proper photo editing tool for sharing precious maternal memory. \n3. Editing photos of babies need special tool like stickers, different text fonts etc. that is not present in current photo sharing apps. \n\nOur goal is to fill the gap by providing parents a space (\u201cGiggly\u201d), where they can ask questions for the duration of getting pregnant to raising their child and get help from other parents who might have experienced the same problems before. We are trying to help making parenting easier for new parents and expectant parents, by building an engaged community where they can share, discuss their pregnancy/baby development, issues and get advice,comments from people who have also gone through the same situations.",
